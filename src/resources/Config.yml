# Setup Notes
#   - Seconds
#         Basic Table:
#           1 minute = 60 seconds
#           1 hour = 1 minute * 60 = 3600 seconds
#           1 day = 1 hour * 24 = 86400 seconds
#           1 week = 1 day * 7 = 604800 seconds
#   - Database
#           Do not use remote databases from free sites, please use either a
#            remote database from a personal hosted VPS or DEDI or a local
#            database. This will prevent any 'timeout' or 'invalid settings'
#            or 'cannot connect to database' issues. Thank you :)!

System:
  Default:
    Currency:
      # Major is the first segment [Major].Minor
      Major: [ 'Dollar', 'Dollars' ]                # Major ([Major].Minor) 1.00 Dollar (With Seperate 1 Dollar)
      Minor: [ 'Coin', 'Coins' ]                    # Minor (Major.[Minor]) 0.23 Coins  (With Seperate 0 Dollars, 23 Coins)

    Account:
      # Default account balance when created
      Holdings: 30.0

  # Controls how money is formatted through methods
  Formatting:
    # Minor allows you to use the Minor amounts for amounts <1
    # Example (true) 0.23 Coins and 1.23 Dollars (false) 0.23 Dollars and 1.23 Dollars
    Minor: false

    # Seperate allows your money to be shown in an alternative way,
    # instead of 1.32 it will show as 1 Dollar 23 Coins
    # !!! NOTICE: This only works if Minor is set to true !!!
    Seperate: false                               # Example (true) 1 Dollar, 23 Coins (false) 1.23 Dollars (Only if Minor is true)

    # Single shows your money in another alternative way.
    # Instead of 1.23 Dollars you will see: 1 Dollar.
    # If your money is 0.23 you will see 0 Dollars if Minor is false, 23 Coins if Minor is true.
    # !!! Notice: This overrides seperate !!!
    Single: false

    Interval:
      #  Interval is done in seconds, here is a easy reference table for commonly set intervals:
      #   1 minute = 60 seconds
      #   1 hour = 1 minute * 60 = 3600 seconds
      #   1 day = 1 hour * 24 = 86400 seconds
      #   1 week = 1 day * 7 = 604800 seconds

    Amount:
      # The balance to be met where we stop giving interest.
      # 0.0 for no limit
      Cutoff: 0.0

      # Percentage of holdings to give / take (Negative to take) (Overrides Min/Max)
      Percent: 0.0

      # This is range based, to set a "flat" or "constant" rate, set each (Maximum and Minimum) to the same number.
      # If the two numbers are different, it will be a random amount in-between the two.
      Maximum: 1
      Minimum: 2

  Database:
    # Databases Supported:
    # Flatfile, FF, mini, minidb
    #  - These all equate to miniDB
    ##
    # item, items, inventory, inventoryDB
    #  - These all equate to InventoryDB, which uses inventory for storage
    ##
    # mysql, mysqldb
    #  - These will attempt to connect to MySQL
    ##
    # sqlite, sqlite2, sqlite3, sqlitedb
    #  - These will attempt to create & connect to SQLite
    ##
    # postgre, postgreSQL, postgreDB
    #  - These will attempt to connect to PostgreSQL
    Type: 'minidb'
    
    # These are for InventoryDB only.
    # MajorItem is the item or block ID of the major currency
    # MinorItem is the item or block ID of the minor currency
    # e.g. MajorItem: 266, MinorItem: 265 for Gold/Iron
    MajorItem: 266
    MinorItem: 265

    # This controls the database name, by default it is iConomy
    Table: 'iConomy'

    # URL is for SQL Databases Only
    ##
    # Path to iConomy folder is easy, it's the COMPLETE path.
    # (Mine) G:\MineCraft\plugins\iConomy\
    # Won't be the same as yours, but it usually looks like that.
    ##
    # [H2DB Default] h2:path/to/iConomy/folder/iConomy;AUTO_RECONNECT=TRUE
    # [SQLite Default] sqlite:path/to/iConomy/folder/iConomy.db
    ##
    # Binary Databases use ip:port style connections.
    # ip
    #  - is the connection identifier (internet protocol)
    #  - for ipv6 usually encased in brackets [::1]
    # port
    #  - the port that the database is listening on
    #  - defaults: 3306 for mysql, postgre is either 5740 or 5432
    ##
    # [MySQL Default] mysql://localhost:3306/iConomy
    # [Postgre Default] postgresql://localhost:5740/iConomy
    URL: 'mysql://localhost:3306/iConomy'
