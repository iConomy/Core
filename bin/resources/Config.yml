# Setup Notes
#   - Seconds
#         Basic Table:
#           1 minute = 60 seconds
#           1 hour = 1 minute * 60 = 3600 seconds
#           1 day = 1 hour * 24 = 86400 seconds
#           1 week = 1 day * 7 = 604800 seconds
#   - Database
#           Do not use remote databases from free sites, please use either a
#           remote database from a personal hosted VPS or DEDI or a local
#           database. This will prevent any 'timeout' or 'invalid settings'
#           or 'cannot connect to database' issues. Thank you :)!

      # This is range based, to set a "flat" or "constant" rate, set each (Maximum and Minimum) to the same number.

  Database:
    # Databases Supported:
    # Flatfile, FF, mini, minidb
    #  - These all equate to miniDB
    ##
    # item, items, inventory, inventoryDB
    #  - These all equate to InventoryDB, which uses inventory for storage
    ##
    # xp, exp, orb, xpdb, expdb, orbdb
    #  - These all equate to ExperienceDB, which relies on Experience for balance.
    ##
    # mysql, mysqldb
    #  - These will attempt to connect to MySQL
    ##
    # sqlite, sqlite2, sqlite3, sqlitedb
    #  - These will attempt to create & connect to SQLite
    ##
    # postgre, postgreSQL, postgreDB
    #  - These will attempt to connect to PostgreSQL
    Type: 'minidb'
    
    # These are for InventoryDB only.
    #
    # InventoryDB is essentially Physical Money.
    #   It isn't logged in a database, its based on the users inventory
    #   and the two items selected below.
    #
    # MajorItem is the item or block ID of the major currency
    # MinorItem is the item or block ID of the minor currency
    # e.g. MajorItem: 266, MinorItem: 265 for Gold/Iron
    MajorItem: 266
    MinorItem: 265

    # This controls the database name, by default it is iConomy
    Table: 'iConomy'

    # URL is for SQL Databases Only
    ##
    # Path to iConomy folder is easy, it's the COMPLETE path.
    # (Mine) G:\MineCraft\plugins\iConomy\
    # Won't be the same as yours, but it usually looks like that.
    ##
    # [H2DB Default] h2:path/to/iConomy/folder/iConomy;AUTO_RECONNECT=TRUE
    # [SQLite Default] sqlite:path/to/iConomy/folder/iConomy.db
    ##
    # Binary Databases use ip:port style connections.
    # ip
    #  - is the connection identifier (internet protocol)
    #  - for ipv6 usually encased in brackets [::1]
    # port
    #  - the port that the database is listening on
    #  - defaults: 3306 for mysql, postgre is either 5740 or 5432
    ##
    # [MySQL Default] mysql://localhost:3306/iConomy
